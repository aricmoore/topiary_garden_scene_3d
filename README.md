\# 3D Topiary Garden Scene - The Victorian Garden at Brigdemere Show Gardens in Nantwich, Cheshire



This project is a 3D-rendered garden scene created using C++, OpenGL, and GLSL shaders. It features a variety of topiary hedges, tapered cylinder trees with sphere tops, a torus-shaped hedge, and a flat plane as the ground. The scene supports perspective and orthographic camera views, texture mapping, and lighting for a more realistic appearance.
