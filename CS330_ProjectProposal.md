## Milestone One: Project Proposal

For my 3D scene, I will replicate the Victorian Topiary Garden at the Bridgemere Show Gardens (similar to the garden scene in the examples from the Final Project Review). This image features a gravel path bordered by rows of conical bushes, low rectangular hedges linking the bushes, and a tall, spiral-cut conical hedge rising from the middle of a circular hedge at the very centre of the garden.

I will attempt to replicate at least four of the following objects from the first image:

- **Cones**: Multiple cone shapes will represent the rows of conical bushes that line the path. Cones are simple geometric shapes that are likely good for practising scaling, rotating, and positioning.  
- **Boxes**: Boxes will connect the conical bushes, creating the low, rectangular hedges that line the path. This will allow me to explore connecting and aligning boxes in 3D space.  
- **Torus**: A torus (preferable to a cylinder) will replicate the low, circular hedge at the garden’s centre. This introduces a curved geometrical shape and provides a focal point to the scene.  
- **Tapered Cylinder + Sphere**: A tapered cylinder will form the tall, spiral conical hedge, and a small sphere will round off the tip. I will attempt to simulate the spiral cut with texture mapping or a slight vertex modification, potentially using procedural geometry.  
- **Plane**: A plane will represent the gravel path and surrounding ground, allowing practice with textures, UV mapping, and a repeating gravel pattern.  
- **Background Trees**: Cylinders for trunks and cones or spheres for foliage will add depth and context to the garden, providing practice with object layering in 3D space.  
- **Background Sky**: A single plane can represent the sky, adding depth and context without overcomplicating the scene.

I believe that the topiary garden is an exciting yet achievable scene to render using OpenGL. Each garden object can be built using basic OpenGL primitives. Repeated elements like conical bushes and rectangular hedges allow for efficient placement and scaling, creating a visually interesting composition. Textures and lighting can illustrate shadows between bushes and hedges, and highlight the spiral detail on the central hedge. In the scope of this project, I hope to demonstrate effective use of primitive shapes, transformations, texturing, and lighting while presenting an attractive and recognisable rendition of the Victorian Topiary Garden.
